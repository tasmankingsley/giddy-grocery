# Giddy Grocery - online grocery store

https://tasmankingsley.github.io/giddy-grocery/

This website was a project initally built for a university assignment. The project had a specification to fulfill including: the use of image maps for the catalogue, a product details section, a functional shopping cart, and a checkout confirmation and order form page.

For the assignment, the app was built with php and mysql for the backend and database on aws. However, i have since re-written the php code in js on the front end accompanied with json instead of mysql - in order to more easily host the website on github.
